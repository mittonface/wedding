        <Question
          question="Am I allowed to take photos?"
          answer={
            <>
              <p>
                We prefer the ceremony remains unplugged and that no photos
                (including phones, tablets, cameras, etc) are taken during the
                ceremony. We will have a wonderful photographer throughout the
                entire day to capture memories.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Photos are welcome at any other point throughout the day, and
                you can share them to social media at any point.
